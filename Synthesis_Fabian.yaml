    doc: |
      list here all the materials and samples that are used in the process,
      they may belong to SAMPLE, COMPONENT, or SUBSTANCE classes
      It is either possible to define here for the first time
      or to reference an archive file containing the data.
      Even more: the reagents can be listed here and be referenced in the STEPS,
      or can be defined in the STEP itself.

        Each action pursued during the process should be placed here with a timestamp pin.
        A step can be a preparation step or even a monitoring measurement carried out after the start of the process.
        The timestamp is fundamental as it allows to plot all the quantities one would like to monitor in the same time abscissa.
