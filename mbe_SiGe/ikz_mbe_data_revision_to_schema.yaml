        Overview:
            Category:
                description:
                    A brief pregnant description of the proposed experiment group.
                    It can be seen as a kind of heading for a group of experiments that have the same goal and procedure.
            # insertion for a dropdown menue for used Catergory names as a string with suggestions
            names:
            # qn: when i am using for exp. a string_with_suggestions. are those suggestions putted in the suggestions: part automatically after i used a not suggested string?
                type: str

                    eln:
                        component: EnumEditQuantity
                        suggestions: ['Ge Homoepitaxy', 'Si Homoepitaxy', 'SiGe Heteroepitaxy']
            Motivation:
                description:
                    What is the Motivation behind the group of experiment? Description in around two to five senteces.
                    # written plaintext for motivation description
                    #motivation_plain_text:
            Literature:
                # qn: the possibility to insert a DOI in form of a Hyperlink possible? can I use Url editquantity for that?
                description:
                    In addition to the motivation a section to insert references as DOI which for example the motivation is based on or a glimps of the theoretical backround.
                # insert DOI as an URL

 # Maximilians substrate description               
        Substrate:
            ID:
                description:
                    The ID includes the category of the experiment, the batch number, the substrate element(s) and a consecutive number. e.g. GeHomo_UC_DIK_01_Ge_0001
                    # From the ID, the experiment, i.e. the category, the batch number, the substrate element(s) and a consecutive number should be recognizable at first glance. Example: GeHomo_UC_DIK_01_Ge_0001 stands for Ge Homoepitaxy with germanium substrate from batch UC_DIK_01 the first sample. It is best to automatically generate the ID from the subchapters with the option to manually enter and modify the automatically generated ID.
            Material:
                description:
                    The Elements and the corresponding isotope which are used in the used Substrate.
                    # input of the Elements which are used as substrate. A nice option would be a button which opens a periodic table where I can click on the used elements. In addition a dropdown menue with the used isotope.
            Orientation:
                description:
                    The Orientation and the offcut[°] of the Substrate.
                    # A dropdown menue with options for choosing the substrate orientation with the present offcut in degree [°] 
            Storage_locatian:
                description:
                    The location as room number with the place in this room where the sample can be found. e.g. 19.31.334 office shelf or. HU TEM Laboratory
                    # plain text
            Batch:
                description:
                    The used shortname of the batch where the substrate is comming from
            Producer:
                description:
                    The manufacturer of the Substrate
                    # user input as a string. Maybe in future a dropdownmenue
            Date received:
                description:
                    The date on which the samples were received.
                    # an option to select an day out of an calender 
                
            Dopingtype:
                description:
                    Dopingtypes are n-type, p-type or no doping.
                    # The menu to select p-, n- type or none. Maybe something like 'radio_enum'
            Doping:
                description:
                    Doping in [Ohm*cm]
            Dimensions:
                description:
                    The overall dimension of the sample in lenght(L)*width(W)*height(H) in [mm] when rectangular and in a diameter in [mm] or ["] * height [mm] when circular 
                    # Option to say if rectangular or circular and then respectively L, W and H in [mm] or [mm] or ["] * height [mm]
            Image:
                description:
                    A sketch or a image of the substrate. Can contain a crosssection, an overview picture or something else.
