# Kentaro Kutsukake's NOMAD use case
# Goal: publish data and ML notebook of Kentaro's publiscation "Application of Bayesian 
# optimization for improved passivation performance in TiOx/SiOy/c-Si heterostructure by
# hydrogen plasma treatment". doi: 10.35848/1882-0786/abd869 in NOMAD
# In this Yaml file we conduct the "Data Revision" to fully understand the dataset and prepare a schema file for uploading the data into NOMAD
# datafiles: BO_data.xlsx --> process and characterization data, BO.ipynb --> ML notebook
#
# todo:
#       1. describe BO_data.xlsx --> Kentaro
#       2. write schema file --> Andrea & Sebastian
#       3. (optional) add a minimum of additional metadata to understand context of the datafile. --> see below
#          (e.g. details from the published article about the used instruments, materials, processes etc. and also the ML by BO)
