      description: |
        A coating method for applying a thin (<1 Î¼m thickness) cover to flat substrates 
        where an excess amount of coating solution (in a volatile solvent) is placed on 
        the substrate, which is then rotated at high speed (8000 rpm) for approximately 
        30 s in order to spread the solution by centripetal force. The solvent then 
        evaporates, leaving a thin film. [ https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0640-0422 ]
