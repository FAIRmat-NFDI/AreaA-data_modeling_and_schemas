# Combinatorial Synthesis
Each combinatorial library contains samples wich are their own archives.

The library contains references to the samples.

The samples contain an `index` within the library.

## Thin film Combinatorial
### Library
The library has a grid which maps the sample `index` to the `x`, `y`, (`z`) position.

### Sample
The sample has a:
1. ID
2. Elemental composition
3. Bandgap
4. Optical transmission (R,T arrays)
5. Thickness
6. Resistivity
7. Conductivity
8. Sheet resistance
9. XRD (q array)
10. Annealing temperature
11. Deposition methods
12. Measurement methods
