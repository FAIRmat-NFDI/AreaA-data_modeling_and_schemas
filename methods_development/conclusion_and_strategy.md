# Conclusion
We categorized the methods needed for sample characterization into the follwing groups:

- electrical methods
	- Hall
	- resistance
	- capacitance: DLTS, CV/IV, cyclic voltametry
	- Impedance
	- photocurrent 
	- EBIC
	 
- optical methods
	- add EDX, CL to luminescence activities in Area B
	- absorption spectroscopy: XANES, EELS, UV-Vis, FTIR, Raman, 
	- non-linear methods: pump-probe spectroscopy, sum frequency generation, SHG (second harmonic generation), OKE (optical Karr effect), 

- Magnetic resonance methods
	
- imaging methods:
	- optical microscopy: bright field, dark field, differential interference contrast (DIC),	phase contrast,	reflection interference contrast (RICM), fluorescence, STED, STORM/PALM
	- scanning probe microscopy: AFM, STM, Kelvin Probe Microscopy, STEM, SEM, STXM,
	- RHEED, LEED
	- electron microscopy --> to be extendene in Area B?
	- holographic methods: digital in-line holographic microscopy, elctron holography,
	- tomographic methods: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), electron topography,
	
- Magnetometry:
	- SQUID 
	- magnetic torque measurement (cantilever)
	- susceptibility measurement (AC/DC)

- scattering methods (elastic):
	- XRD
	- SAXS
	- Neutron Scattering
	- Electron Scattering
	- Ion Scattering
	- Rutherford Backscattering 

- mechanical methods (list up later, check other NFDIs)


# Strategy:
How to go on from our first meeting on methods for sample characterization?

Motivation: what needs to be done to keep measurements reproducible?

Next steps:
1. agree with Area B on general categories --> talk to them next Tuesday in their task force meeting
2. working on different methods with real data of methods in subgroups, meet again in 1-2 weeks
3. derive general schema 

Work on this in github --> Sebastian will create a working folder and issue board. Move our content from gitlab to github.
