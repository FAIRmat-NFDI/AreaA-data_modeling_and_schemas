# summarizing what is needed to describe epitaxial samples (layer(s) on a substrate)
- crystal: #used in anything crystalline (e.g., substrate, layer, domain(?)
	- compound: # please cross-check similarities to Tamas' chemical_compound class !
		- chemical formula: # e.g., Ga2O3 - the chemical formula (What about alloys?, e.g. (Al0.4Ga0.6)2O3 or Al0.8Ga1.2O3
		- DOPANT: # can be multiple dopants or impurities
			- element: # chem. symbol, e.g. Fe
			- concentration: # typically given in cm^-3, e.g., 3e18
	- crystal structure: # anything missing or is there a more common definition?
		- space group: # integer number or some other accepted descriptor of the xtal structure, maybr use 0 for amorphous
		- lattice parameters: # a, b, c typically given in A°
		- angles: # alpha, beta, gamma in degrees
	- out-of-plane orientation: # the physical surface may be different if the surface forms facets - may be worth to define a surface class 
		- hkl: # e.g. (1 0 0) three integer numbers
		- offcut:
			- degrees: #, e.g. 2
			- towards:  e.g. (001)
	- in-plane reference orientation: # used for epitaxy, allows to define in-plane epitaxial relation for stacks of xtals, e.g. layer on substrate - in real or reciprocal space ? ([u v w] or (h k l)

- substrate: # description of a substrate, i.e., a single crystalline wafer used in e.g., epitaxy. May also be amorphous (e.g. glass)
	- crystal: # such that substrate can be derived from crystal
	- thickness: # typically given in mm
	- shape: # e.g., 2" dia, 10mm x 10mm or piece, e.g., 1/4 2" or 3mm x 5mm
	- polishing: # 1sp = single sided, 2sp = double sided
	- rms roughness: # or other descriptors of the surface polishing
	- vendor: # text
	- wafer id: # text, e.g. batch and individual wafer or whatever the ID the vendor provides 
	- epiready: yes/no #can the substrate be used as delivered
	- pretreatment: #only for epiready_no, describe treatment of substrate done by grower prior to deposition	

- layer: # 	howto allow for non-single crystallinity (texture/domain structure, polyxtalline, mixture of diff. xtal structures, microstructure such as dislocations)
	- CRYSTAL: # possible multiple if layer consists of different domains, crystal structures ...
	- thickness: # typically given in nm or ML (ML=monolayer, ML thickness depends on crystal structure and orientation)
	- growth: # a reference to the growth/synthesis (?) this is essential

- surface:
	- topology: #closed layer, islands, wires ?? 
	- reconstruction: # unclear, howto describe - check with some expert on terminology for recos.
	- FACETS: # what facet orientations form
		- hkl: # facet orientation=physical surface
		- lateral size: # eg in nm, to get an idea
	- roughness: # typ. determined by AFM
		- lateral image size: # size of AFM image used to quantify roughness, e.g., 1µm
		- rms: # typically in nm or A°
		- peak-to-valley: #maximal height difference of a sample surface
